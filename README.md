# Chem Quiz
The purpose of ChemQuiz is for GCSE Chemistry students to revise for their exams by completing a short multiple choice quiz. They would be encouraged to repeat the quiz if they received less than 70%. It is designed for Secondary school students in England.

## User Stories
- As a first time user, I would want to test my initial knowledge by completing the quiz.
- As a repeat user, I would want to continue to test my knowledge and improve my score.
- As a repeat user, I would want different questions and/or shuffled questions

## Features

## Technologies used

## Design
- Leonardo AI was used to create a Chemistry themed background:

- A grey background was used for the question container to provide contrast to the text. A neutral colour was used for a clean look.

- The font "Outfit" is a sans-serif font. Sans serif fonts are considered to be easier to read for students with dysleixa and autism - since this quiz is designed for teenagers, this was considered to be an important accessibility requirement. Outfit in particular looked clean, classic and in-keeping with the 'Science' theme of the quiz which is why it was chosen.

### Wireframes

## Testing

## Deployment

## Future Improvements
There is currently only one quiz with a bank of 20 questions (each quiz shows a random selection of 10 of these questions). If this project was to be expanded, there would be multiple pages with quizzes for each topic. The bank of questions would also be expanded to cover more of the subject area. The user would also be able to create a username and password to save their scores for each quiz.
